# BattleHackChicago2015
Here you can find all of the files related to our project at the battle hack


If you came here first thanks!  Sorry for all of the complicated files.  I wanted you to be able to recreate this project if you 
wanted to, in order to actually see what we did.  

If you want to see the bulk of the code the last couple of files accomplished most of the implimentation.

If you can't tell immediatly we used Parse for our back end.

It was cool because this was the first time using Parse for any of us, so we ended up learning a lot!

If you have any questions please ask!
